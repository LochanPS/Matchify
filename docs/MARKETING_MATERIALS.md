Our Mission: Making Badminton Accessible to Everyone

Founded in 2024, Pathfinder was born from a simple frustration: finding and organizing badminton tournaments was unnecessarily complicated.

We built Pathfinder to solve these problems and create a thriving badminton community where:
✅ Players can easily discover and join tournaments
✅ Organizers can focus on creating great experiences

✅ The community grows stronger together

Today, we're proud to serve over 50,000 players and 2,000 organizers across India, facilitating thousands of matches every month.

Our Vision: To become the go-to platform for recreational sports in India, starting with badminton and expanding to create communities for every sport.
