Impact:

✨ Regular (3-6 months active)

Why Badges Work:
- Non-judgmental language

New System (Experience-Based):
John Doe 🏆
Veteran Player | 🔥 Consistent

Playing since Mar 2024
8 months of experience

Career Stats:

No pressure, welcoming tone

Case 2: High Win Rate, Low Sample Size
Display: "Building record (2/5 matches)"
Minimum threshold: 5 matches before showing win rate
Avoids misleading "100% win rate"

Case 3: Experienced Player
Display: 🏆 Veteran Player | 🔥 Consistent
Shows: 67 tournaments, 52 wins, 77.6% win rate
Recognition without exclusion
